thruster_model:
    model_delay: 1                  # number of samples delayed (works independently of the rate limiter)

    throttle_rate_limit: true       # control the rate limiter
    throttle_rising_limit: 5.0      # simulated feedback rising limit (this has been measured experimentally)
    throttle_falling_limit: 5.0     # simulated feedback falling limit (this has been measured experimentally, was 3.0)
